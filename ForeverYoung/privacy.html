<h2 id="pp1" class="scroll-dest">1. What Is Personal Information?</h2>

<p>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” means information that you voluntarily submit to us and that
  specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or email address) or
  information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal Information
  can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Site, and
  information about you that is available on the internet, such as from social media, web companies, or publicly
  available information that we acquire from service providers. Personal Information does not include
  “aggregate” information, which is data we collect that cannot be used to identify an individual,
  pseudonymous data, encoded or anonymized information, and/or aggregated data we collect or create about a group or
  category of services, features, or users, which does not contain personally identifying information. Our Privacy
  Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>

<h2 id="pp2" class="scroll-dest">2. What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>

<p>We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, including, without limitation, the information you
  enter if you create an account or profile, send us an email, enter into a subscription agreement or end user license
  agreement with us, request user support, or submit or post content to the Site.</p>

<p>We may automatically collect certain information when you use the Site including, without limitation, your Internet
  Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a
  referring site and your activity on the Site. We may also collect information from mobile phone users in a similar
  manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we may collect mobile screen resolution, device
  make and manufacturer, and may also collect the device’s unique identifier (in the iPhone’s case, a UDID),
  and, with your permission, your location. We treat this information as Personal Information if we combine it with or
  link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>

<p>We may also receive personal information from third parties about their users, and may combine this information with
  other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy will govern the combined
  information.</p>

<p>We may also receive personal information from users about third parties, and may process this information with other
  Personal Information we maintain about you for purposes of fulfilling user requests or providing services. However,
  such information is not otherwise stored by us, is not re-used in connection with other user accounts, and is not sold
  to third parties.</p>

<p>The Site may now or in the future allow users to send messages to each other. These messages may be stored for
  retrieval at later times in order to facilitate user communication.</p>

<p>The Site may now or in the future allow users to make transactions. Data will be securely stored when a transaction
  is made, including the date and type of purchase made, your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and
  CW or security code number.</p>

<p>Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account or cease use of our services, copies of
  that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise
  distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. If you post any of your
  information to a public area of the Site, please be aware that it is no longer “Personal Information” for
  purposes of this Policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to
  personal or other information, including your email address or name, to other users through the application of any of
  our privacy controls or other Service or Site settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Company has no control
  over nor liability for how others may collect, use, or disclose such information.</p>

<h3 id="pp3">3. What Aggregated and Non-Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>

<p>We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the
  Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have
  been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer
  visitors to our Site to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online
  advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p>

<p>When you visit the Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to the Site and to
  personalize your online experience. Cookies enable us to customize and personalize your experience on our Site,
  including the products and promotions that are offered to you. Essentially, a cookie is a small amount of data that is
  sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer’s hard drive. Through the use of a cookie,
  we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Site, such as the web pages you visit,
  the links you click, and the searches you conduct on the Site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
  usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not
  be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features or services we offer.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies from Third Party Vendors</strong><br>
  Various third party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to the Forever Young
  website and other websites.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google's use of cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to Fitness Blender users based on their visit
    to the Forever Young site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out by visiting the advertising <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">opt-out page</a>. Users can also opt out of other third-party
    vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org">opt-out page</a>.</li>
  <li>Fitness Blender uses Amazon Associates links for various products. When an Amazon link is clicked the user is
    taken to an Amazon webpage and their privacy policy applies.</li>
  <li>Forever Young uses Power Systems Affiliate Program Links for various products. When a Power Systems link is
    clicked the user is taken to a Power Systems webpage and their privacy policy applies.</li>
  <li>Forever Young uses HotJar for user experience improvements and feedback. Users may opt out by visiting the <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/legal/compliance/opt-out">opt-out page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pp4" class="scroll-dest">4. Children</h2>

<p>COPPA Compliance/Children’s Privacy. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") is a
  law created to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. Company’s Site does not target children, and
  is not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. If you are under the
  age of 18 years of age, you may register with Company or provide your personal information to Company only if you have
  the consent of your parent or legal guardian. Only if you are a subscriber over the age of 18 may you grant access to
  the Site to your minor children or those for whom you are guardian or responsible (“child”) and, by doing
  so, you agree that (a)&nbsp;Company may provide services to and collect personal information provided by your minor
  child and (b)&nbsp;you and your child will be bound by and comply with this Privacy Policy and the Company <a href="/page/terms-of-use-agreement">Terms</a>. You may withdraw your consent by notifying us in writing at <a href="mailto:Forever Young.com">service@Forever Young.com</a>. Company does not knowingly collect personal
  information from minor children without such consent. As noted, you provide consent by registering your child for the
  Site and, in that case, will only use the information associated with such account to provide the services and as
  outlined in this Privacy Policy. You may review the personal information your child has supplied to us and modify or
  correct it and, upon your written request and subject to the caveat below, we will delete the personal information
  your child has provided to us. We will delete your child’s personal information (and yours) when your
  subscription ends. We will never request personal information from your child in any of our public posting areas and
  we will not require your child to provide more personal information than is necessary to provide the services you have
  authorized your child to use. PLEASE REMIND YOUR CHILD NEVER TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THIS SERVICE OR ANY
  OTHER SITE WITHOUT FIRST GETTING YOUR CONSENT. If at any time Company learns that a child under the age of 13 has
  submitted personal information to its online sites, we will take all reasonable measures necessary to remove such
  information from Company’s databases and not use such information for any purpose except where necessary to
  protect the safety of the child or others or as required by law.</p>

<p>FERPA Compliance. With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in
  the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. Schools should
  always notify parents about these activities. For more information on parental rights with respect to a child’s
  educational record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("<strong>FERPA</strong>"), please
  visit the FERPA site at <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="pp5" class="scroll-dest">5. How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?</h2>

<p>In General. We may use information that we collect about you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliver the products and services that you have requested;</li>
  <li>Manage your account and provide you with customer support;</li>
  <li>Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products,
    services, or content offered by others;</li>
  <li>Communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone, and/or mobile devices about products or services that may
    be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;</li>
  <li>Tailor your user experience;</li>
  <li>Develop and display third-party content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Site and other sites;
  </li>
  <li>Enforce our <a href="/page/terms-of-use-agreement">Terms</a>;</li>
  <li>Manage our business; and</li>
  <li>Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Financial Information. We may use financial information or payment method to process payment for any purchases,
  subscriptions, or sales made on or through the Site or in connection with our services, to protect against or identify
  possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Purchases. If you purchase products or pay for services via the Site, the transaction will be handled by our
    service vendor responsible for processing your payment. This vendor has its own privacy policy and those terms will
    apply to you. Please be sure to review them at the links provided during payment processing. Our vendor’s
    policies are also considered a part of this Privacy Policy and part of your agreement with us.</li>
  <li>Credit Card Information. We will require your payment or credit card information in order for our payment vendor
    to process purchases. This includes your name, payment or credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and
    authentication codes or related information as needed to authorize the charge and complete the transaction. Credit
    card data is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (“<strong>SSL</strong>”) line if you are using an
    SSL enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome. We also use SSL on other
    select pages where you enter Personal Information. This ensures that the Personal Information is encrypted as it
    travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your
    computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the upper right-hand or left-hand
    corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first
    characters of the site address will change from http to https.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please review “Your Control” and “What Choices Do You Have Regarding the Use of Your
  Information” below.</p>

<h2 id="pp6" class="scroll-dest">6. What Personal Information Do We Share with Third Parties?</h2>

<p>We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you
  or your activities on the Site or while using our services.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong>. We do not share your Personal Information with others except as indicated
  herein or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information shared. We may
  share Personal Information with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Authorized Service Providers: We may share your Personal Information with our authorized service providers,
    including advertisers and corporate partners, who perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include
    fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing
    business analysis, supporting the functionality of the Site and our services, and supporting surveys, offering
    additional or related services, and other features offered through or in connection with the Site. These service
    providers may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share
    or use such information for any other purposes.</li>
  <li>Other Situations. We also may disclose your information:
    <ul>
      <li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a
        law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal
        claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right
        available to us, in our sole discretion.</li>
      <li>When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report, or take
        other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights,
        property, or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or
        cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the terms and conditions that apply to our Site or other
        agreements or policies.</li>
      <li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture,
        merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Any future companies to whom we
        may work with will be consistent with our own privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We will work to ensure that any third parties to whom we may disclose Personal Information will be consistent with
  this Privacy Policy. Those additional privacy policies will govern use, handling, and disclosure of your Personal
  Information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn
  more about third-party privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Aggregated and Non-Personal Information</strong>. We may share aggregated and/or non-Personal Information we
  collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted
  advertising on the Site, through our services, and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-Personal
  Information we collect with additional non-Personal Information collected from other sources. We also may share
  aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers, and investors, for the purpose of
  conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website
  and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personal Information and may
  be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target
  content and advertising.</p>

<h2 id="pp7" class="scroll-dest">7. Social Media</h2>

<p>The Site may include social media features, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube widgets, or interactive
  mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the
  Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either
  hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the
  privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>

<p>Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

<h2 id="pp8" class="scroll-dest">8. Your Control</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain
    features of the Site and our services because such information may be required in order for you to register,
    purchase products or services, participate in a survey, event, or promotion, ask a question, or initiate or engage
    in other transactions on the Site or through our services.</li>
  <li>When you register on the Site you may be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or
    newsletters about product updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by
    us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by using
    the email address associated with your account to send an email to <a href="mailto:service@Forever Young.com">service@fitnessblender.com</a> with the word “Unsubscribe” in
    the subject line. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of
    receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to ten (10) days for us to process an opt-out request. We may
    send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements,
    administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note
    that changing information in your account or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications
    will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a
    third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you have changed your preferences or updated your
    information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pp9" class="scroll-dest">9. Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>The Site may contain links to other sites. Any Personal Information you provide on the linked sites is provided
  directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. This Privacy Policy does not
  apply to such linked sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies
  of these sites or any other sites that are linked to from our Site.</p>

<h2 id="pp10" class="scroll-dest">10. What Steps Do We Take to Protect Your Information Online?</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and
  unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no
  security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any
  interception or other type of misuse. If we become aware of a security systems breach, we will attempt to notify you
  electronically using the contact information we have available so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We
  may post a notice through the Site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling
  you to access our Site. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to use in these
  circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in
  writing.</p>

<p>Users should also be aware of how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending
  Personal Information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/</a> for information about how to protect yourself
  against identity theft.</p>

<h2 id="pp13" class="scroll-dest">13. Information Retention</h2>

<p>We may retain Personal Information for as long as we have a business need for it or as applicable laws, regulations,
  or government orders require us to retain it. Additionally, the Site and/or our services may enable you (or other
  users) to save information including information that you have made public or allowed certain users to access or see.
</p>

<h2 id="pp14" class="scroll-dest">14. “Do Not Track”</h2>

<p>Section 22575 of the California Business &amp; Professions Code requires website and online service operators to
  disclose whether they honor web browser “Do Not Track” settings. Our capabilities at this time prohibit us
  from honoring the “Do Not Track” web browser settings. Other third parties may or may not honor Do Not
  Track signals. These parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across
  different web sites when you visit the Site, for example by using cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control
  over other parties’ Personal Information collection practices, even those with which we may have an affiliation.
  You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of any website you visit. For more information about Do Not
  Track, please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>


<h2 id="pp16" class="scroll-dest">15. Changeability</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy, the Site, and the services we offer at any time to
  reflect changes in our business, practices, or to keep current with relevant laws or industry standards. We may
  attempt to notify registered users of material changes by sending an email to the email address you most recently
  provided us in your account, profile, or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by posting
  notice of the changes on the Site. Your access to and/or use of the Site and our services will be subject to the most
  current version of this Privacy Policy posted on the Site at the time of your access or use. We recommend that you
  check the Site from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy, and stay apprised of any
  other Policies that may be applicable; you are solely responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any
  modifications to this Privacy Policy.</p>
