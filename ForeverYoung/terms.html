<h2 id="tos7" class="scroll-dest">7. Commenting and Comments</h2>

  responsible for any errors or omissions in such postings, or for hyperlinks embedded in any messages. Under no

<h2 id="tos8" class="scroll-dest">8. Important Information about Children</h2>

<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-
  center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-
    center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions</a>) requires that online service providers obtain
  parental (or legal guardian) consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children
  who are under 13. Company’s Site does not target children, and is not intended to be used by children without
  involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. Therefore, we only knowingly collect personal information through
  the Services from a child under 13 where that parent or guardian (or a student’s school, district, and/or
  teacher has agreed to obtain parental/guardian consent for that child) to use the Services and disclose personal
  information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a child or student under 13,
  please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your parent, guardian, school, district, and/or
  teacher has not provided this prior consent to us, and please do not send any personal information other than what
  we request from you in connection with the Site. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child or
  student under 13 without parental/guardian consent being obtained or if we learn a child under 13 has provided us
  personal information beyond what we request from them for the Site, we will delete that information as quickly as
  possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this
  paragraph, please contact us at <a href="mailto:service@ForeverYoung.com">service@ForeverYoung.com</a>.</p>

<p>Parents and legal guardians, if your child is under the age of 13, consent may need to be given in order for such
  child to use certain features of the Site. You are responsible for understanding how the Site you use, subscribe to,
  make available, and/or distribute on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of
  Company’s Site. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created a User Account with us and
  you did not receive an email seeking your consent, you can email us at <a href="mailto:service@ForeverYoung.com">service@ForeverYoung.com</a> to have that child’s User Account
  deleted.</p>

<p>If you are a school, district, company, or educator, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for
  complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or legal guardians whose
  children under 13 will be accessing the Site. You are responsible for understanding how the Services you use,
  subscribe to, make available, and/or distribute on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information
  of users of Company’s Site. When obtaining consent, you must also appropriately provide parents and legal
  guardians with our <a href="/page/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. You must keep all consents on file and provide
  them to us if we request them. If you are an educator, you represent and warrant that you have permission and
  authorization from your school, company, and/or district to use the Site as part of your curriculum, and for
  purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your
  school, company, and/or district. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member’s employment with any
  school, company, and/or district, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access
  they have in their possession.</p>

<h2 id="tos9" class="scroll-dest">9. Purchases</h2>

<p>Company reserves the right not to accept or process orders that do not comply with our business policies and/or
  vendor agreements. Items ordered via the Site may be subject to shipping or processing limitations, such as shipping
  only to physical addresses located in the United States, or no shipping to P.O. boxes or APO/FPO addresses, and
  applicable limitations will be noted in connection with available items or during the purchasing process. All
  services and products offered by Company are provided subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, and local laws.</p>

<p>All orders are subject to acceptance by Company and availability. By submitting a purchase request to us (directly,
  or through our Site or our authorized vendors or affiliates) for any item, you represent and warrant that all
  information submitted to us in connection thereto is complete and accurate. At our discretion, purchase requests
  will be processed, but we reserve the right not to accept your purchase request at our sole discretion. In such
  case, we may inform you by email or via your User Account.</p>

<p>Prices (if any) indicated on each item page are exclusive of applicable taxes. Prices are subject to change. However,
  such changes will not impact the price or the description of the items for which you have already submitted a
  purchase request.</p>

<p>You may pay for your order using the payment methods available on the Site. The price for the purchase of items and
  the corresponding costs for shipping, delivery, and/or tax, as indicated by Company, may be charged to your chosen
  available payment method. You agree to pay Company (or our authorized vendors or affiliates) in full as identified
  in the purchase process via the Sites or the third party method. To ensure that your credit or debit card is not
  being used without your consent, Company (or our authorized vendors or affiliates) may validate your name, address,
  and certain other personal information supplied by you in placing the order. Company reserves the right to implement
  any additional and/or other payment security system from time to time.</p>

<p>The appearance of items displayed on the Site may not exactly correspond to actual items in terms of image,
  dimensions, and color depending on your Internet browser and/or your monitor quality.</p>

<h2 id="tos10" class="scroll-dest">10. Refunds and Returns</h2>

<p>Refunds or returns, for whatever reason, if available for the product or service ordered, of any payment to be
  received by you may take place using the same method of payment you chose during the check- out procedure. Company,
  including any of its authorized vendors or affiliates, will not be responsible for any delays or conditions beyond
  its control, including without limitation delays caused by the method of payment/refund or those attributable to the
  card issuer or delays in shipment or delivery.</p>

<p>Generally, we are not able to approve a return for a non-defective item, and some items are not returnable in any
  case, due to their nature. Please do not open the product if you do not plan to keep the item you purchased. If you
  desire to return an opened product, we typically cannot take it back. If an exception is made, we reserve the option
  to charge a fifteen percent (15%) restocking fee.</p>

<p>For any returns, we do not credit back any shipping charges paid on the original order and do not pay or reimburse
  for any return shipping back to us.</p>

<h2 id="tos11" class="scroll-dest">11. Third Party Stuff</h2>

<p>The Site allows (or may in the future allow) you to select, input, upload, and share information and data in
  connection with and through designated user accounts maintained by you on certain third-party social media platforms
  or via third parties for services (together, “<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). The Site allows
  (or may in the future allow) you to access Third Party Services using the Site to post, link, message users of Third
  Party Services, or otherwise act on a wide variety of information accessed by the Site and originating from user
  accounts on Third Party Services, and to collect data and generate reports based on these activities (collectively,
  “User Materials”). You are solely responsible for User Materials. By accessing Third Party Services
  through the Site, you represent and warrant that you have the lawful right to access such Third Party Services, and
  that the creation, distribution, and reproduction of the User Materials complies with the terms applicable to the
  Third Party Services. You shall ensure that your use of the Site, including access to or use of User Materials with
  the Site and Third Party Services, does not contain code, files, content, or programs that may interrupt, destroy,
  or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment, including, without
  limitation, by introducing viruses or similar code into the Site, hosted systems or servers, or systems or servers

  provided for in your Subscription Agreement or, if not specified in your Subscription Agreement, on our standard
  pricing as may be available through our Site. You are responsible for all fees related to your initial term as well

  services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your access to or use of such. All fees
  charged by Company are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be
  responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties excluding taxes based solely on Company’s income.
  For any paid Site services, including Subscription Agreements or other services or features available only to a
  certain User Account, after seven (7) days, unless otherwise agreed by both you and us and memorialized in your

  charged on the day you sign up for such or enter into a subscription for such and will cover access to or use of
  such for a period as indicated or the term for which you subscribed. Payments are made for the upcoming billing
  cycle and are immediately due upon the first day of such. You will be billed for the relevant services, access, or
  content, as applicable, until you properly terminate your subscription (and corresponding User Account, if any) or
  Company terminates your Subscription Agreement and/or User Account. Your termination may not take effect until
  completion of the billing cycle for the then-current term.</p>

<p>We will bill the fees due under your Subscription Agreement or for any other agreed-to services to the credit card or
  other payment option you provide to us or select during registration (or to a different credit card or payment
  option if you change your payment information). You acknowledge that the amount billed for each renewal term may
  vary due to promotional offers, changes in the subscription or Site, changes to our standard pricing, and changes in
  applicable taxes, and you authorize us to bill you the corresponding amounts.</p>

<p>You also authorize your credit card issuer, bank, or payment service to pay any amounts described herein and
  associated with your User Account and authorize us (or a billing agent acting on our behalf) to continue charging
  all such amounts to your credit card account, bank account, or payment service account until you or we terminate
  your Subscription Agreement as provided herein or these amounts are paid in full, whichever is later.</p>

  of purchasing such subscriptions, products, or services from us. You further authorize us to store your credit card,
  bank, and/or payment service information. You must of course provide us with current, complete, and accurate
  billing, credit card, and Registration Data information. At the beginning of each billing cycle Company will make
  attempts to charge the applicable fee to the credit card, bank, or payment service on record, and if we are unable
  to process the payment due, the relevant subscriptions, products, or services, and your access to them, will be
  immediately disabled. You must also promptly update all billing information to keep your User Account and
  Registration Data current, complete, and accurate, and you must promptly contact Company if your credit card or
  other relevant account information is lost, stolen, compromised, or if you become aware of a potential breach of
  account security. You authorize us to obtain or determine updated or replacement expiration dates for your credit
  card or other payment method in the event that such, as you provided to us, expires or is terminated. We reserve the
  right to charge any renewal card or payment method issued to you to the same extent as the expired or terminated
  card or payment method. If payment is not received from your credit card issuer, bank, or payment service, you agree
  to pay all amounts due upon demand. You also agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorneys’ fees
  and costs, on any outstanding balance. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. Company
  reserves the right, with respect to any amount not paid when due, to charge a finance charge equal to one and
  one-half percent (1.5%) of the unpaid balance per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable usury law,
  whichever is less, determined and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid.</p>

<h2 id="tos16" class="scroll-dest">16. Termination</h2>

  end of the then-current subscription term. Termination is not available during any designated free trial period. To
  close your User Account or terminate your Subscription Agreement, please email us at <a href="mailto:service@ForeverYoung.com">service@ForeverYoung.com</a> or as otherwise indicated by Company
  from time to time. Suspension, amendment, or termination does not relieve your obligation to pay amounts due and

<p>If you do not amend your subscription to another subscription, upon terminating your Subscription Agreement or any
  User Account you have with us you will immediately lose all access to the relevant subscriptions, products, or
  services and any data or information stored within your User Account or associated with the cancelled Subscription
  Agreement.</p>

<p>If you upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Agreement, your credit card or other payment provider as indicated in
  your User Account information may be immediately charged for the new subscription fees as stated in your new
  Subscription Agreement. Any downgrading of your subscription becomes effective at the end of your then-current

  liability for any such loss.</p>

  threatened breach of these Terms regarding Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to us, and in
  addition to any other remedies at law or in equity that we may have, we are entitled, without the requirement of
  posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. You
  agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any damage, loss, cost, or liability (including reasonable attorney

  and consultants, and their respective directors, employees, and agents, harmless from and against any and all actual
  or threatened suits, actions, legal proceedings, judgments, and any other legal claims, damage awards, or other
  compulsory payment or performance of any kind arising out of, resulting from, attributable to or in any way
  incidental to: (a)&nbsp;your access to or use of the Site and/or the Site Materials; (b)&nbsp;your conduct;
  (c)&nbsp;your violation of these Terms; (d)&nbsp;your violation of the rights of any third party; and (e)&nbsp;any
  User Content posted by you. Company is not liable for any loss or damage that results from your failure to comply
  with your obligations in these Terms or from unauthorized access to or use of your User Account or subscription.</p>

<p>We will, at our election and expense, either defend you from or settle any claim, proceeding, or suit
  (“<strong>Claim</strong>”) brought by a third party against you alleging that your use of the portion of
  the Site provided by us infringe or misappropriate any patent, copyright, trade secret, or trademark, right of any
  third party, and indemnify you from all damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees finally awarded in any such Claim
  or paid to any third party to settle any such Claim, subject to the following limitations: Our obligation under this
  section is contingent on your giving us prompt written notice of the Claim; your granting us full and complete
  control over the defense and settlement of the Claim; and your providing assistance in connection with the defense
  and settlement of the Claim as we may reasonably request, at our cost. You will not defend or settle any Claim
  eligible for indemnification under this section without our prior written consent. Our obligation to indemnify,
  defend, or settle under this section is obviated should you alter the Site or any Site Materials, or use such
  contrary to these Terms or the terms of your Subscription Agreement, if you use a version of such that has been
  superseded, if the Claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Site or Site Materials
  provided to you, or if you continue to use relevant portions of the Site or Site Materials after the end of your
  license. Further, Company shall not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon any
  information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material not furnished by us, for any portion of
  a Claim that is based upon the combination of the Site or Site Materials with any products or services not provided
  by Company, for infringement or a Claim caused by your actions against any third party if the Site or Site Materials
  as delivered to you and used in accordance with the Terms or your Subscription Agreement would not otherwise
  infringe or violate any third party rights, or for any Claims known to you at the time licensed rights are obtained.
</p>

<p>If you are enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using the Site or a portion thereof based on an allegation that the
  Site violate any third party intellectual property right (including a Claim), or if we reasonably determine that
  such prohibition is likely, then we will, at our sole expense and option: (a)&nbsp;obtain for you the right to use
  the allegedly infringing portions of the Site; (b)&nbsp;modify the allegedly infringing portions of the Site so as
  to render them non-infringing without substantially diminishing or impairing their functionality; or
  (c)&nbsp;replace the allegedly infringing portions of the Site with non- infringing items of substantially similar
  functionality. If we determine that the foregoing remedies are not commercially reasonable, then we may terminate
  the impacted Subscription Agreement, or portion thereof, and will promptly provide a prorated refund to you for any
  prepaid fees received by us for any services properly engaged that have not yet been performed at the time of
  termination. However, we will have no obligation for any infringement or misappropriation to the extent that it
  arises out of or is based upon use of the Services in combination with other products or services if such
  infringement or misappropriation would not have arisen but for such combination; any aspects of the Site that are
  provided to comply with designs, requirements, or specifications required by or provided by you, if the alleged
  infringement or misappropriation would not have arisen but for the compliance with such designs, requirements, or
  specifications; use of the Site by you for purposes not intended or outside the scope of the license granted to you;
  your failure to use the Site in accordance with written instructions provided by us, if the infringement or
  misappropriation would not have occurred but for such failure; or any modification of the Site not made or
  authorized in writing by us where such infringement or misappropriation would not have occurred absent such
  modification.</p>

<p>This section states Company’s sole and exclusive liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for the actual
